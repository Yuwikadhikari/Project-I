      <h1>About Himalayan Chai Cafe</h1>
      <p>Founded in 2018 by local entrepreneurs Rajesh and Sushma Tamang, Himalayan Chai Cafe emerged from a passion to preserve and celebrate Nepal's rich culinary and cultural heritage. Our journey began with a simple dream: to create a space that feels like home, where traditional flavors meet modern hospitality.</p>
        
      <p>Located in the vibrant Bharatpur neighborhood of Chitwan, our cafe is more than just a businessâ€”it's a community platform. We are committed to supporting local farmers, artisans, and cultural practitioners. Every cup of chai, every snack, and every workshop is an opportunity to share the warmth and diversity of Nepali culture.</p>
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>We aim to:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Promote authentic Nepali culinary traditions</li>
          <li>Create a welcoming space for cultural exchange</li>
          <li>Support local economic development</li>
          <li>Provide high-quality, sustainably sourced products</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Whether you're a local resident, an expat, or a traveler exploring Nepal, Himalayan Chai Cafe welcomes you to experience our story, one cup at a time.</p>
